# Section 1: Tool Access and Repository

## 1.1 Accessing the TARE Model Repository

**Repository Location:** https://github.com/jordan-joseph126/cmu-tare-model

**Repository Status:** Currently private (public release planned after documentation completion)

**Recommended Access Method:** 
- **For Current Development:** Contact the repository owner for collaborator access
- **For Future Public Access:** Clone or download directly from GitHub once made public

**Getting Repository Access:**
```bash
# Once you have access, clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jordan-joseph126/cmu-tare-model.git
cd cmu-tare-model
```

## 1.2 Repository Structure Overview

The TARE model is organized into a clear, modular structure designed for research reproducibility and ease of use:

### **Main Package Directory: `cmu_tare_model/`**

**Core Analysis Modules:**
- `model_scenarios/` - **Primary execution scripts and Jupyter notebooks**
  - `tare_baseline_v2_1.ipynb` - Baseline scenario analysis (active)
  - `tare_basic_v2_1.ipynb` - Basic retrofit scenario analysis (active)
  - `tare_run_simulation_v2_1.ipynb` - Main script to run all scenarios
  - Additional scenario scripts for moderate and advanced retrofits

**Functional Modules:**
- `private_impact/` - Private cost-benefit calculations and equipment costs
- `public_impact/` - Climate and health impact calculations
- `adoption_potential/` - Technology adoption potential analysis
- `energy_consumption_and_metadata/` - Energy usage data processing
- `utils/` - Utility functions and shared calculations

**Data Directory: `data/`**
- `euss_data/` - End-use savings shapes database from NREL
- `fuel_prices/` - Regional fuel price data and projections (EIA)
- `retrofit_costs/` - Equipment and installation cost data (NREL REMDB, pre-v4.0.0)
- `projections/` - Future energy and emissions projections (Cambium, NEI)
- `marginal_social_costs/` - Marginal social costs for carbon (SCC) and health-related pollutants (PM2.5, SOx, NOx)

**Configuration and Setup:**
- `config.py` - Project configuration and path management
- `constants.py` - Model constants
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `setup.py` - Package installation configuration

### **Key Entry Points:**
- **Main Analysis:** Start with the main model run notebook `tare_model_main_v2_1.ipynb`
- **To work with individual scenario files:** Navigate to the `model_scenarios/` folder
- **Individual Functions:** Specific modules can be located within their respective directories (e.g., the `public_impact/` folder contains the climate, health, and public impact/NPV scripts and other modules in the `calculations/` and `data_processing/` subfolders)

## 1.3 Version Information and Updates

**Current Version:** 2.0 (as specified in setup.py)

**Development Status:** Production/Stable (5 - Production/Stable in setup.py)

**Update Frequency:** Research-driven updates as model improvements are developed

**Accessing Updates:**
```bash
# Check for updates (once public):
git fetch origin
git pull origin main

# View version information:
python setup.py --version
```

**Version History:** Currently managed through git commits; formal releases planned for public version

## 1.4 Licensing and Attribution
